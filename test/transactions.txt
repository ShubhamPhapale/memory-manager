# Allocate 100 bytes
allocate 100

# Allocate another 200 bytes
allocate 200

# Deallocate memory from previously allocated block (reduces reference count)
deallocate 0  
# Assuming the starting address for the first block is 0

# Allocate new block of 75 bytes, should use freed space
allocate 75

# Deallocate remaining allocated blocks
deallocate 100
deallocate 300

# Allocate large block, potentially requiring compaction
allocate 500

# Print the current memory state
# Extra functionality of calling print with default argument 1 in the input file itself
print 1

# Optionally, test a larger allocation after compaction
allocate 1000
