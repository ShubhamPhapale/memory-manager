# Memory Management Simulator

## Overview

This Python program simulates dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in a system similar to interpreted languages like Python and Java. It implements techniques like reference counting and memory compaction for efficient memory management.

## Key Features

- Simulates memory allocation and deallocation using linked lists.
- Employs reference counting to track memory block usage.
- Performs memory compaction to reduce fragmentation.
- Processes input files with allocation/deallocation transactions.
